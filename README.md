# Flask Application for Running an Interactive Viewer

This is the Python Flask backend code corresponding to the Unity application found [here](https://github.com/RaymondGuo2/ExpressionChangeUnity/tree/03567a24e11c4982f0a0273b0b0fded5ef72e97d). It adopts the rendering pipeline from the original [FFHQ-UV repository](https://github.com/csbhr/FFHQ-UV) to process the request from the user of the application.

Still in ongoing development, please stay tuned for further developments.
